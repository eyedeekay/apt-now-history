Details
- -------

This tool, currently called apt-now but soon to be changed to repo-now, is
essentially a static site generator geared toward generating and
formatting a specific type of content in a specific type of way, the content being
GNU/Linux or Android/Linux binary packages, and the format being a signed repository
accessible from the web or something like it(It can also, for instance, be used to
statically host software repositories over i2p with no substantial modification.) It
does this by taking advantage of the structural regularity of these types of resources
and constructs the whole site on the client side, transmitting content to the server
only after a valid repository has been built. This means that the server doesn't have
to run any code at all to present the site to the end-user taking advantage of the
resource over the web, doesn't need to support ssh or remote desktop, and doesn't even
technically need to support ftp or git, as long as a way of transferring the
repository to the remote storage service can be included in the program.

Using Docker
- ------------

        git clone https://github.com/cmotc/apt-now && docker build -t apt-now .
        docker run -p 45291:45291 \
                apt-now

Use Cases
- ---------

  * Personal Use: Independent, hobbyist, and self-employed developers can use
  this program to host their own packages in a way which allows them to use
  their package management interface, encourages them to learn more about their
  choices of software and GNU/Linux distributions, and which provides an easy
  way for them to back up their configuration.
  * Educational Use: Educational and corporate training programs which work with
  Open-Source projects can use this program to host code repositories for
  employees during training, and in turn their trainers and supervisors can
  follow versioned updates and use them to build redistributable packages of
  viable projects.
  * Activist Use: Activists who deliver things like privacy and security related
  packages that might find their main repositories censored in some regions can
  use this tool to maintain mirrors on sites which will prove much more
  difficult to keep people from accessing, like "burner" accounts on free
  file hosting sites, distributed file systems, and fire-and-forget hidden
  services.
  * Small Groups: Small groups of hobbyists and hackers can collaborate on
  projects and take advantage of the instant clonability of github repositories
  to create instant mirrors of their group's packages, sharing, testing, and
  growing their projects potential userbase and lowering barriers to entry for
  their ideas.
  * Small Businesses: Small businesses can save costs on hosting their in-house
  process software and encourage a culture of peer review by hosting both their
  source repositories and tiny package repositories on github, bitbucket, or
  similar versioned web hosting services.
  * Large Businesses: Larger businesses which allow their employees to use "20%
  time" or similar programs to develop projects can use this in conjunction with
  tools like dh\_make or fpm to roll out an instant package repository when a
  program is ready for testing with a wider audience.

If you're one of these people and you have a bitcoin or two lying around, you
could send them my way and support development.

Versioning and Features
- -----------------------
Right now, binary repository generation for Debian(APT Repositories) is stable and
source repository generation for Debian/Apt is nearing stability and are in usuable
form. While these are the only working types of repositories, the pre-hyphenate part
of this project's name will be "apt." Additionally, while an end user could use any
means to transfer the repository constructed by the apt-now tool, there is currently
only support for the use of github-pages as a hosting medium in the code. While this
remains the case the post-hyphenate part of this project's name will be "git." When
experimental support for F-Droid and Redhat(Yellowdog Updater) are complete,
additional ways of transferring the files will be considered and added, and the final
version will implement APT, YUM, and F-Droid repositories in an easy to configure,
polyglot(But probably not agnostic) way.

You should be aware that if you use this, your .git directory will be visible
to all users of the repository, allowing them to completely copy the repository
and it's entire history. It assumes that is what you want. If you don't, you
must remove the .git directory manually. In the future, a command-line option
will be provided.

###Repository Types
  * Debian/APT
    - Binary Repository(Complete, Stable, Generates Web Pages from package info)
    - Source Repository(Pretty much complete and stable. Generates pages from package info.)
    - Notes: Depends on normal debian tools, including reprepro
  * Android/F-Droid
    - Binary Repository(Experimental, Unstable, broken, see fdroid-git. The
	documentation for fdroidserver sometimes implies that the system requires
	some small amount of server-side code.)
    - Source Repository(Research phases)
    - Notes: Android implies somewhat different separation of logic from GNU/Linux
  * Redhat/YUM
    - Binary Repository(Experimental, Still researching, but from the looks of
	things it's really straightforward. I do not know how to build RPM packages
	though, so we'll be working with Fedora's rpm's.)
    - Source Repository(Experimental, Still researching, but the YUM paradigm
	seems to be astoundingly simple.)
    - Notes: None yet. But I'm sure there's something.

###Transport Types
  * Version-Controlled
    - git(Complete as a way up updating the server, but can't be used to
	retrieve inpidual software packages or update software. Cloning is pretty
	much like making an instant mirror, which is cool.) Will be considered
	complete when a repository can be initialized and cloned from in the
	apt-now directory in the absence of a configured web-based git account.
    - hg(Not started, but straightforward. Pretty much the same as the git code
	with very little alteration, just some transliterating of commands with
	identical benefits.) Will be considered complete when fulfilling the
	same requirements as git.
    - svn(Not started, but basically the same story for the purposes of this
	system.) See above.
  * File Transfer Based
    - FTP(Not started, but really pretty easy, involves composing some commands
	and configuring some usernames/passwords/keys/etc.)
    - SFTP(Not started, but basically maps onto ftp. Probably like, one
	additional line of code and a teeny bit of planning to support.)
  * More Exotic, Sync, Filesharing oriented
    - bittorrent(Not started, probably will work with [apt-p2p](http://www.camrdale.org/apt-p2p/)
	or [debtorrent](http://debtorrent.alioth.debian.org/) with minimal to no
	modification. Might have to generate some magnet links. Probably going to
	conflict with Tor, but may be able to encourage use within i2p?)
  * Self-Hosted
    - Self Hosting with local static httpd written in go. Stupid easy to turn
	on, just build the web site with the -l / --serve command line option
	or the START\_HTTPD option in the config file/environment variable.
    - i2p eepsites are now also supported, and in fact this exact repository is
	mirrored at [fireaxe.i2p/apt-now](http://fireaxe.i2p/apt-now), or
	[ov3ev5dplhdz6ipy442ftb4kzz4dembm3ifs2jo25qhiyw6f4ogq.b32.i2p/apt-now](http://ov3ev5dplhdz6ipy442ftb4kzz4dembm3ifs2jo25qhiyw6f4ogq.b32.i2p/apt-now)
	if you need the b32 address.
    - Tor HS are now also supported and automatic, and they are also available
	as a mirror at [hmuc3ffhrehwuenz.onion/apt-now](http://hmuc3ffhrehwuenz.onion/apt-now)
	to prove the concept. If you're only interested in making packages
	available to Tor users and not your own anonymity, you can omit
	LOCAL\_ONLY\_HTTPD.

###Misc Features
  * Output a site. Collect information from within the packages, list them in
  well-formatted markdown files, and emit the markdown into html files which
  link to eachother, also a sitemap. This is all really easy to do on the client
  side.

On Deck
- -------

   * Break more functionality into smaller chunks. Right now the generate
   function is huge and duplicates a pretty sizable amount of code. Write a
   generic function for building according to script, then existing spec, then
   guessing. This will make supporting more package types and more package
   building tools and techniques easier.

Related Projects
- ----------------

  * [Reprepro, obviously](http://mirrorer.alioth.debian.org/) for APT repo
  management
  * [Createrepo, also obviously](http://createrepo.baseurl.org/)
  for YUM repo management
  * [Fdroidserver, also also obvious](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver)
  * [Effing Package Management](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm) Some
  packages depend on this, but it isn't in may repo's besides the ruby gems
  somewhat ironically.
  * dh\_make, live-build, lots of others, I mean it's a package management
  component, so it's loosely related to almost everything if it has to be.
